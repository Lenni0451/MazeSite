# Maze Generation & Solving Algorithms Showcase
Welcome to the Maze Generation website, an interactive and educational platform for visualizing and comparing various maze generation and solving algorithms. Explore how different methods construct complex labyrinths and race solvers against each other to find the optimal path.

This has been inspired by [Slopcity](https://github.com/MaxRobinsonTheGreat/slopcity), a project which showcases multiple AI generated pages (and one of them is a maze generator and solver).

> [!WARNING]
> This entire project, including its structure, HTML, CSS, and all JavaScript logic for maze generation and solving, was **100% generated by an AI** using the Gemini CLI.\
> It serves as a test and demonstration of AI's capability in creating a complete, functional web application from a high-level concept.\
> I have not modified the original code in any way, so it is probably bad and 100% *AI slop*.\

## Features
This website is divided into four main sections, each offering a unique way to interact with the algorithms:
### 1. Algorithm Overview (`index.html`)
- A gallery of implemented maze generation algorithms.
- Each algorithm includes a concise description of its methodology.
- Features an embedded mini-playground for instant maze generation and solving.

### 2. Side-by-Side Comparison (`compare.html`)
- A grid view displaying mazes generated by all available algorithms simultaneously.
- Allows for easy visual comparison of the textures, patterns, and biases each algorithm produces.
- A "Solve All" button instantly reveals the solution for every maze on the grid.

### 3. Interactive Playground (`playground.html`)
- A full-featured sandbox for generating and solving mazes with fine-tuned control.
- Customize Your Maze:
  - Select from various maze generation and solving algorithms.
  - Adjust the maze size (Small, Medium, Large).
  - Control the animation speed for both generation and solving.
- Live Stats: Watch the number of steps each algorithm takes in real-time.

### 4. Solver Race (`solver-race.html`)
- Pit different maze-solving algorithms against each other on the same maze.
- Generate a maze using any of the available generator algorithms.
- Watch as Breadth-First Search, Dijkstra's, and A* race to the finish, with live stats on their progress.
