# Maze Generation Website Outline

This document outlines the plan for creating a static website dedicated to showcasing maze generation algorithms.

## 1. Project Goal

To develop a modern, interactive, and educational static website that provides an overview of various maze generation algorithms. The site will feature visualizations, a comparison grid, and a dynamic playground for users to explore how different algorithms create and solve mazes. The entire application will run in the browser and will be designed for easy extension with new algorithms.

## 2. Core Features

- **Algorithm Overview Page:**
    - A main page listing all implemented maze generation algorithms.
    - Each algorithm will have a description of how it works.
    - A small, embedded playground next to each description to generate a sample maze.
    - Each small playground will also feature a "Solve" button that instantly displays the correct path through the maze.
- **Algorithm Comparison Page:**
    - A grid view that displays mazes generated by all available algorithms side-by-side for easy visual comparison.
- **Dedicated Playground Page:**
    - A full-featured playground for generating and solving mazes.
    - **Controls:**
        - Select maze generation algorithm.
        - Select maze size (e.g., small, medium, large).
        - Control animation speed for generation and solving.
    - **Visualization:**
        - The maze generation process will be animated, showing the algorithm at work.
        - A "Solve" button will trigger an animated maze-solving algorithm (e.g., A* or Dijkstra's) to find and display the path from start to finish.
- **Solver Integration:**
    - All generated mazes (in small and dedicated playgrounds) will have a "Solve" button.
    - The solving process will be animated to be visually appealing.

## 3. Design and UX

- **Theme:** A modern, dark-mode theme will be used across the site.
- **Animations:** All transitions and algorithm visualizations will be fluid and smooth.
- **Layout:** The site will be responsive and easy to navigate.

## 4. Technical Stack

- **HTML:** For the basic structure of the pages.
- **CSS:** For styling, including dark mode, animations, and layout. We will use modern CSS features for a clean look.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all the logic, including:
    - Maze generation algorithms.
    - Maze solving algorithms.
    - DOM manipulation for rendering the mazes and animations.
    - Handling user interactions in the playgrounds.

## 5. Project Structure

The project will be organized as follows to ensure modularity and ease of maintenance:

```
/
|-- index.html
|-- compare.html
|-- playground.html
|-- css/
|   |-- style.css
|-- js/
|   |-- main.js
|   |-- maze.js
|   |-- renderer.js
|   |-- algorithms/
|   |   |-- recursive_backtracker.js
|   |   |-- prims.js
|   |   |-- ... (other generator algorithms)
|   |-- solvers/
|   |   |-- a_star.js
|   |   |-- ... (other solver algorithms)
```

## 6. Algorithm Implementation Strategy

To make the system easily extensible, we will use a class-based or factory function approach for the algorithms. Each algorithm will be in its own file and will conform to a specific interface.

- **Generator Interface (Conceptual):**
  ```javascript
  class MazeGenerator {
    constructor(grid) { ... }
    *generate() {
      // Yields steps for animation
    }
  }
  ```
- **Solver Interface (Conceptual):**
  ```javascript
  class MazeSolver {
    constructor(grid) { ... }
    *solve(startNode, endNode) {
      // Yields steps for animation
    }
  }
  ```

This structure will allow us to add new generators or solvers simply by creating a new file that implements the required interface and then registering it in the main application.

Please review this outline. I will await your feedback before proceeding with the implementation.
